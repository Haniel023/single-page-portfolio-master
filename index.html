            <p>Hello! My name is Jether Haniel A. De Leon. I lived somewhere around Silang, Cavite. Currently, I am taking BSIT at Adventist Univesity of the Philippines. </p>

                    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
                    <p>Being "likable" or having a "good personality" are highly contingent and context dependant attributes, “Your prison-bound uncle's personality may not be likeable at the Thanksgiving table, but it may serve him well once incarcerated. Supreme communicators have a keen ability to shift gears when the context calls for it, and a deep well of communication options to choose from. This way, they can respond accordingly to what the current situation requires.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-grid2">
                        <h3>Negotiation skills</h3>
                        <p>Good negotiating skills are beneficial with both internal and external discussions, “Internally, job offers and salary discussions greatly benefit from solid negotiating, as well as when it's time to pitch a new idea or sway coworkers to your way of thinking.  Externally, both vendors and customers often require negotiations and you can really become the hero when you are successful in either scenario.”</p>

                <div class="skill-grid3">
                        <h3>A great sense of humor</h3>
                        <p>“Who doesn’t enjoy laughing? It’s ‘the great diffuser’ of tension and conflict. If you can jam the system of tension or routine with levity, you will thrive in your job,”, “It was once said that ‘nobody ever died of laughter,’ and if you can retain some lightheartedness in your job, you’re likely to get more air time during meetings and overall.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-grid4">
                        <h3>Strong communication skills</h3>
                        <p>This is the most fundamental people skill because it encompasses your persona and ability to get along with other colleagues, persuade others to listen to your ideas, and much more, “If you have a gift for the spoken and written word, you will always put your best foot forward. Being articulate is highly prized in today’s workplace, when time is at a premium and technology requires constant communication.”</p>
